            Overview
          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Topic </p>
              <p>Our project involves the design and development of a prototype smart-mirror product. Our team strives to innovate on existing technologies, creating new and fresh iterations of them. Ideally if given enough time, our team would like to create new software and hardware from scratch which would provide a more authentic product that is tailored to the requirements of the project. To do this, our team will work together to learn new skills and tools which can be utilised in this project such as new programming languages, new hardware and troubleshooting skills as well as utilising our existing skill set and improving upon them. This will allow our team to achieve our ultimate goal of gaining experience relevant to the technologies that will be used in the project and therefore outside of this project in actual real-world scenarios which we may face in the future.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Motivation </p>
              <p>Our motivation for this project is mostly a learning experience as most of our team had never worked with some of the tools and resources that will be required for this project. This project fits in with current IT trends as it is a tangible product which utilises current technologies such as ‘Smart-technology’ and touch-screen technology which now is almost an industry standard when it comes to smart products. The project will show that our team is able to learn new concepts and technologies in a short amount of time as is often required in the IT industry and demonstrates our practical capabilities with it. It also demonstrates the skills we have gained in programming, design and cooperation.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Landscape </p>
              <p>In a growing IT landscape, it is very difficult to come up with a product that is entirely new. Instead of doing that, our team has decided to innovate on existing ideas and improve them, therefore theoretically providing better alternatives. Our project involves the creation of a ‘smart mirror’ and while there are existing products for this, we believe that there are many areas to be improved in. Some of our ambitions include the use of motion detection and the integration of AI such as Google assistant, user customization and it; touch control of which only a few smart mirrors have all the mentioned features.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Aim </p>
              <p>For the aim we have decided it was to be "Work as a group to research and create the product we envisioned'' this is because we strive to complete our project in full without leaving anything behind but at the highest quality so that people would be able to experience what we have envisioned our product to be and how it could be compatible to every consumer. We believe that teamwork is the most crucial part of the project because without it we wouldn't be able to complete anything, therefore, the "Work as a group" is the aim, just to show the importance of it.</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Goals </p>
              <p>The goals for this assessment are to "Research what parts we need", "Build the SmartMirror",  "Test the product", "Write a report", "Create the website", "Double check everything", "Submit the work" and "Enjoy the assessment". These are the small goals our group would like to follow through in order to complete the assessment. The first goal is to research what parts we need, this part is partially done in assessment 2 yet we still need to research further to get an understanding of which IT product works well with each other or if it's not compatible. Building the SmartMirror is the next goal and it is an important part of the assessment as all our preparation from coming up with the idea to researching it has brought us to actually building the product. The third goal is "write a report" is goal is just as important as it notes down our findings for each prototype as well as writes down everything that happened from thoughts/feelings to what we used etc... The next goal is to create the website this is where we would add the written report and have it online a website to make it more professional.
              </p>
              <p>The next goal is to double-check our work to make sure all the actual product is functioning properly, working at their peak performance and if the report is up to standard. Submitting the assessment would be next as we would like to finally be able to show people what we have come up with and demonstrate the full potential the SmartMirror has. Lastly, the final goal is to enjoy this assessment, this goal was added as we would like to enjoy creating something we as a group came up with the idea, and so the enjoyment would encourage us to work hard and strive to achieve the aim. If things do not go as planned then the goals would be "Did everyone in the group have fun? Which part of the project was the hardest to complete? What did the group end up completing?" these goals were chosen because it would allow us to evaluate which area we got up to before we ran out of time. The aim would be to "complete as much as we can while still having fun" I believe that we should try our best to achieve as much as we can without straining ourselves but at the same time enjoying the project and who is a part of it.

            Plans
          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p>Our project is based on the creation and utilisation of a ‘smart mirror’. The project’s main function primarily was to provide a more convenient and centralised display of information for users. Typically, users can see this information such as the date, time, reminders, news, and weather reports on their smartphones. However, the smart mirror provides this information without the hassle of going through numerous apps and has the added benefit of reducing screen time in the morning. This in turn allows users to have more time to get ready for the day. Our ‘smart mirror’ project was based on three main features. The first feature was the collection and display of important daily information that included weather reports, current news events, and user-chosen news topics.</p>
            <p>This data would be gathered mainly by free APIs that can be easily implemented through the Raspberry Pi. The second feature was that the ‘smart mirror’ would activate upon detection of a user. This could be done through several methods which range from video, sound, light, etc. The main method would most likely be light or motion detection through a video camera device of sorts. As a video camera provides data on user movement and expands the capabilities of the ‘smart mirror’ by making it possible to add more features. Such features as gesture control and providing image data of the user to further assist with advice on skincare and clothing choices.
            </p>
            <p>The third feature was the collection of data to assist the user to determine the best course of action in regard to skincare and clothing choices for any day of the week. The clothing choice feature could provide suggestions on clothing to wear based on the weather data such as temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Which was previously collected by the weather APIs. For example, Through the weather information, we could give advice such as wearing breathable clothing on hot days or wearing thicker clothes on chilly windy days. The skincare feature would be the biggest side of the project as it is the most overwhelming. As it is very difficult to provide precise and concise information about the overall health of a person’s skin through a simple device such as a ‘smart mirror’. The feature could be done via artificial intelligence that would analyse an image of the person’s skin and based on that AI’s analysis we could output advice and information. However, this would require a lot of research and development, as well as trial and error.
            </p>
            <p>As it is a big undertaking to produce solid, concise and accurate data and advice to match the needs of each user. As we would have to address many different users’ needs and skin types. Apart from the three main functions of our project. Optional auxiliary functions that could be considered AFTER the implementation of the main functions are user customization and personalization. Other optional features for customization or display include widget placement, health information from a compatible device or application, upcoming reminders/appointments, calendars, traffic reports and more. We would undergo this process via the use of more free and open source modules or use a software like Tkinter with python to make a graphical user interface. The user with this would be able to add and customise the information that they wish to see. Furthermore, if we got around to adding LED light to the ‘smart mirror’, we would allow the user the ability to adjust the colour, warmth and light level/brightness of the mirror. This would be done by hooking up the lights to the Raspberry Pi and either programming and linking the lights to a python script or program that allows the user to make all these changes.
            </p>
            <p>If we have enough time two additional features are for the mirror to be able to play sounds from either the monitor or installed external speakers so that it could play music or videos as the mirror could act as a media player of sorts. For the video player, we would need to install a screencast module to play videos and for music, a module such as “MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify” could be implemented into the Raspberry Pi to play music. However, due to these features, we would now need a connection via WI-FI, Bluetooth or an Ethernet cable running into the Raspberry Pi. Our last feature was the vibrating alarm bed,  scrapped due to insufficient funding and time as this was a very ambitious task which would require additional time in coding, R&D and many trials to get working. The whole project is being developed on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or A. As for the monitor we were to get a touch screen or just a plain monitor that we could take apart and re-wire to use as the smart mirror. An OLED display would allow us to have a clearer view, as well as make the smart mirror look better. The black on the screen makes the reflection stand out more since blacks on OLED are perfect black instead of a greyish colour that you normally get from a normal LCD panel.
            </p>
            <p>However, this would cost us extra. With the monitor we would also have to of course make the frame and use one-sided material to create the mirror in hand with the monitor.</p>

            Progress
          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Week 1 - Small Development (How it began) realising camera and other features too ambitious with funding and time constraints</p>
              <p>In this week we did some small development on the project. Such as going over the plan and rewriting some features of the product. We eventually realised that some of these features were way too ambitious and overwhelming with our current time frame and our current funding. This meant many sides and auxiliary features such as user customisation and linking to other health applications/devices may or may not make it into the final project.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Week 2 - Gathering the computing device</p>
              <p>Week 2 was the week we chose the device we would use to pair up with the smart mirror. A new Raspberry Pi 4 was way too expensive with our current funding and other small computing devices such as Arduino were also still pretty pricey. We settled on a second hand Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or A? Which was handed over to Tyson since Tyson, Matt and Dylan live more closely to each other and would be able to collaborate more easily.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Week 3 - Gathering of Mirror materials and small development</p>
              <p>During week 3 Tyson and Matt gathered the monitor for the smart mirror and also picked up the materials to help construct the mirror. For the monitor, we decided to not make it a touch screen. This was done due to us declaring that there wasn’t enough time or funding to undertake this feature as well as implement it. When Tyson and Matt built the mirror they used a cheaper alternative method. Instead of using an actual one-way mirror, they placed film onto a clear plastic sheet. If we had actually used a mirror it would have given it a better ‘mirror effect’, since it’s difficult to apply the film consistently.</p>
              <p>This was also done as one-way mirrors are super expensive and require way more time to get. And due to us having less time we opted for a faster and cheaper method. We also decided to use an LCD panel for the monitor of the smart mirror to save money, however, if we had more funding we would have used an OLED panel to make the mirror look way cleaner and better. Need to start construction of the hardware before we start coding on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Week 4 - Raspberry Pi development</p>
              <p>In week 4, On the software side of things. Tyson booted up the Raspberry Pi and first tried to install the ‘MagicMirror’ software. However, he ran into many problems. Because the Raspberry Pi was pre-owned it already had a Pi OS loaded onto it. However, the version of OS was very old and seemed to be corrupted in a few ways. This was evident when Tyson attempted to install software via NPM which caused issues with the NodeJS, this was due to It missing some libraries. Tyson had to unplug the SD card and connect it to a PC. Using a Pi imaging tool, he flashed the Pi OS onto the SD card which was an hour-long process. Once the OS finished installing, the SD card was plugged back into the Raspberry Pi to initiate the set-up sequence which took some time. After the OS finished installing onto the Pi and being able to boot to the desktop. NodeJS and NPM were installed in the terminal and cloned ‘MagicMirror’ software. The initial startup was successful but more issues arose. After making edits to the config file and the CSS, visual elements would not display in the application causing more headaches. The issue was resolved when the syntax errors were fixed. Moving on to implementing the various modules.
              </p>
              <p>An Openweathermap account was created to obtain an API key. Then edits were made to the config file and CSS to display the relevant information on the screen. After the weather module was successfully added. Tyson attempted to install other auxiliary and side modules such as the MMM-Screencast module, to allow the ability to play Youtube videos on the mirror. However several issues arose when trying to install it. The initial attempt with the Screencast module failed due to errors while installing dependencies.</p>
              <p>However, Tyson fixed the errors and got it to “work” per se. His phone now has the option to cast to ‘raspberry pi’. But Tyson believes there to be an error still and that the lacklustre performance of the Pi is hindering the ability of the module to work. Essentially at this point, we realised due to hardware performance, time and funding constraints some modules couldn’t be implemented. If we had purchased a better or more powerful Raspberry Pi or had more time to upgrade the Raspberry Pi. And had the funding to do all these things a lot of our planned features and functions would have made it into the project.</p>

            Roles
          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p>Within our group there are some roles that are important to note down, yet besides that our group doesn't have roles as we believe each member should work on an assigned part of the assessment but at the same time help each other if one of us are having trouble and can't move forward. But if we were to assign roles then the roles for the four members in our group would-be programmers, these are the people who would help program the website as well as help program the smart mirror to display certain information. Another role would be someone like a hardware engineer who would help build the actual product (smart mirror) so install everything needed for the product, ensure the equipment used is compatible with everything else etc.</p>
            <p>The third role could be the user designer where they would design the interface of the product making it appealing to users as well as the other group members, for this project they won't just work on the design of the smart mirror but would also work on the design of the website and how everything should be organised like. The last role would be the manager/ report writer, with this role the manager would manage the whole time making sure everyone is on time for their game yet still having fun and helping every member if they are having trouble. The manager would also write more of the report as that individual would check on each other the group members and could summarise what happened and note down their progress. These roles are interchangeable, and they would change regularly as it would make things easier and fair, balancing the work within the group. Our group doesn't really like to give role title but instead give out a designated task that each member has to complete but the task reflects what each member's strengths are so like the programmer role would suit certain members more than others.

            Scope
          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p>In consideration of the given time for Assignment Three, we were constantly gauging how far the prototype of the magic mirror could be taken and properly function without any external help.  While we felt that an interactive mirror could be built well but whether we could scale it up to a larger mirror was beyond our current scope and capabilities. As we realised that most limitations were within the availability of materials and our access to them, we justified that we would not be able to implement the motion detection feature for the mirror as we did not have access to a camera that could be functional for that feature. This was also true for the touch screen feature as we lacked the material of a touch screen monitor nor had the time to code it for it to successful function. Another loss was the API for the user skincare action plan as we were starting to run short on time and would not be able to programmable a feasible API that would function well enough. However, the programming of the raspberry pi and the implementation of interactive systems such as APIs were considered to be our target scope for the initial prototype. We felt that we could add simple APIs like weather and news as well as an interactive word display with phrases to compliment the users. One thing to note about our limitation was due to the materials being collected very late, most of the distinct features had to drop in order to maintain full progress on a functional prototype.

            To write up the interface for the Magic Mirror, most of the coding will be made from Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript. These particular coding styles are chosen due to their flexibility in coding new features and having lots of room for personal customisation. Application Programming Interfaces or APIs are also used to create more interactive interfaces and most of the APIs used are built-in with Javascript. The CSS would be primarily used for just design and appearance such as text font style and size as well as API position and interface layout. The software in the mirror is a web application which is why it could be used in anything that we could run it on.</p>

          <p>As with any product, pre-testing is highly important to make sure that a product is as ready as possible to be used by consumers with very few bugs and issues as possible. Our product will be tested pre-production using multiple methods including user-testing, some of the expected user inputs and product outputs for the main features are shown below:</p>
          <img src="images/testing.PNG">
          <p>These can be easily tested throughout production where each individual function is checked against the expected output. If the observed output differs from the expected output in a negative way, troubleshooting and adjustments may be made to the product to solve the issues. Post testing is also highly important and should be done after the completion of the prototype, where bugs and issues are recorded. Once testing is completed, the team can work together to come up with solutions and the product can be updated accordingly.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p>Our project is based around the main components of a raspberry pi and coding of the software for the raspberry pi. Coding and working with the software of the raspberry pi may be difficult to work with as no one in our group has had experience with a raspberry pi. Also learning the device and coding the device's software may be hard to learn or code. Furthermore, the usage and implementation of an open-source platform such as the “MagicMirror²” could pose some difficulties. Due to the extra work of working with and learning the platform as we go. Furthermore, the platform we choose could potentially not be documented well, be very un-optimised, and may not have the features and modules we originally wanted and wrote about. Since we are purchasing a secondhand Raspberry Pi 3, we may run into some issues and risks. We don’t know the true condition of the device, such as if it’s still in an optimal and usable state. There could be issues running the software and installing the OS. As the device may be damaged or corrupted in a way. Several APIs and other software we want to install onto the Raspberry Pi may just flat out also not work due to several reasons. Another issue includes the re-using of a monitor by taking it apart and hooking it up to the Raspberry Pi. Risks with not knowing how to do it, the monitor flat out not working or we wrongly hook up the monitor to the Pi.

            Group
          </div>
          <div class="tab_content">
            <p>With our group we are mostly online most of the time and the only time we communicate in person is when we have class together. For the most part, we communicate through discord as it is more versatile and easy to join a call on our laptop, computer, and even mobile phone. While having the discord app on our phone it is easier to message each other as we mostly travel places with our phones so messaging each other on discord using our phone would easily get a quick response.</p>
            <p>With collaborating work our group would use Notion, this is a place where we would bring all our work together to have it stored in one place so that if someone is unavailable the team would still be able to see what would work, they are currently up to through the shared place. So, using notion we post the task everyone is expected to do and should have done by the next time we meet etc...</p>
            <p>Microsoft teams is another place where we would do our meetings, discord is where we do our short meets just small inquiries. But with Microsoft teams we use it for our important meetings where we would have to record the session and note down important situation that has happened for example if a certain person has completed a certain section or is falling behind with this important information, we can judge the next few actions based on the results so either start work on the next section or give the other a helping hand. Also, in these Microsoft team meetings, we do one once a week as our group feel that there is no need to have more than one meeting in a week as it would consume time as well as having to find peoples available so that we would have everybody present during the meeting so that no one with miss out important information that could relate to them.</p>
            <p>Everyone in the group for the most part is online, we as a group are a group of friends so we never have communication issues as we're constantly already talking to each other so when it comes to a group project that is not an issue as we see each other nearly every day anyways. If any group member is not active, we would at least try giving them a call out ping them on discord to try and get their attention, if that doesn't work then we would wait until they see the messages and fill them in on what is happening.</p>
